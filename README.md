## 📚 About The Project

Minishell is a 42 School project that implements a simplified Unix shell with Bash-like functionality. This project dives deep into **process control**, **file descriptor management**, and **system programming**, providing hands-on experience with core operating system concepts.

Key features:
- Interactive command line interface with prompt
- Command execution with PATH resolution
- Advanced parsing with quote and variable expansion
- Redirections and pipes
- Signal handling (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, Ctrl-\)
- Built-in commands (echo, cd, pwd, etc.)
- Environment variable management

## 🏁 Getting Started

## 🧠 Technical Implementation
### Core Architecture
Lexer: Tokenizes input into commands, arguments, and operators

Parser: Builds abstract syntax tree (AST) from tokens

Executor: Handles command execution, redirections, and pipes

Built-ins: Native shell commands implemented directly


### Key Components
| Component        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prompt**       | Customizable prompt showing current directory with ANSI colors              |
| **History**      | Persistent command history with up/down arrow navigation (using readline)   |
| **Lexer**        | Tokenizes input into commands, arguments, operators, and redirections       |
| **Parser**       | Validates syntax and builds execution tree with proper operator precedence  |
| **Expansion**    | Handles `$VAR` environment variables and `$?` exit status expansion        |
| **Redirections** | Manages `<` (input), `>` (output), `<<` (heredoc), `>>` (append)           |
| **Pipes**        | Implements `|` with proper process forking and inter-process communication |
| **Signals**      | Handles Ctrl-C (SIGINT), Ctrl-D (EOF), Ctrl-\ (SIGQUIT) like bash          |

### Built-in Commands
| Command   | Options Supported          | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `echo`    | `-n`                       | Prints arguments without trailing newline when `-n` specified               |
| `cd`      | `[dir]` or `~`             | Changes directory with path resolution (`~` for home, `-` for previous)     |
| `pwd`     | None                       | Prints absolute path of current working directory                          |
| `export`  | `[name[=value]]`           | Sets environment variables (no args prints all exported vars)               |
| `unset`   | `[name]`                   | Removes environment variables                                               |
| `env`     | None                       | Prints all environment variables                                            |
| `exit`    | `[n]`                      | Exits shell with status `n` (default 0)                                    |


## 🚀 Bonus Features
Logical operators: && and || with command grouping

Wildcards: * expansion for current directory

Parentheses: Priority grouping for command execution

 ## 📝 Evaluation Criteria
Correctness: Matches bash behavior for specified features

Memory Management: No leaks (except readline's known leaks)

Error Handling: Graceful handling of invalid commands

Signal Handling: Proper response to Ctrl-C/D/\

Bonus: Logical operators and wildcard implementation

## 🧑‍💻 Peer Evaluations (3/3)
Peer 1: "Great job Ola and Poonkodi! We went thru most of mine tests, and all works perfectly!. Also they showed some part of code and they can explain every little detail in the code. Good job with future projects!"

Peer 2: "I want to commend both girls for the outstanding work on the minishell project. You did a great job creating a stable and functional mini-terminal. Everything works as expected, and the code looks very clean. Well done!"

Peer 3: "In a nutshell, This project is shelling out a lot hard experiences. Big Big thumbs up to Ola and Poonkodi for the long long long effort they combined towards the completion of this project. Of course, there were a little minor issue, but their project didnt crash nor leak memory. It was a roller coaster of a project. Thank you for sharing this with me"
